Here is the updated brief, tightened to your constraints and design answers.

## Working title

**Local Agency Growth Calculator**
Live style estimator that shows SEO, PPC and web agencies how many local clients and how much MRR they can realistically add each month with your outbound system.

---

## 1. Purpose and scope

This document is for the dev building v1.

**Goal:**
Create a multi step, mobile friendly web app that:

* Takes a few simple inputs from an agency owner who sells to local service businesses.
* Runs a transparent model based on your internal stats per niche.
* Shows a **range** of expected leads, appointments, clients and MRR.
* Feels like a **live model backed by your database**, not a static calculator.
* Ends with a strong CTA to book a call.

No real scraping, no real enrichment, no live mail sending.
It is a story driven estimator that shows how your engine behaves for their niche.

---

## 2. User and ICP

**User:**
Owner or decision maker at an agency that sells to local businesses:

* SEO retainers
* Google Ads management
* Web design or dev
* Or full service local marketing

They typically serve niches like plumbers, dentists, roofers, gyms, med spas, etc, in the US or UK.

**Mindset when they use this:**

* Slightly skeptical
* Curious how you get to 1 to 2 new clients per month
* Wants concrete numbers and an obvious connection between their inputs and your outputs

---

## 3. Inputs to collect

We are keeping personalization lean. These are the only inputs that affect math or copy.

1. **Target industry**

   * Example: plumbers, dentists, electricians.

2. **Agency service type**

   * Options: SEO, Google Ads, Website design or development, Multi service, Other.
   * Used only for copy and framing, not for math.

3. **Case study strength**

   * No clients yet in this niche
   * Some clients with decent results
   * Strong proven case studies
   * Optional free text result example.

4. **Pricing range per client**

   * Low end monthly fee (USD)
   * High end monthly fee (USD).

5. **Self reported close rate on qualified calls**

   * Slider or segmented control: 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent.
   * Default 20 percent if they skip.

6. **Prospects per month (your volume)**

   * Slider, default 10k, limited by industry TAM.

7. **Sales capacity per month**

   * “How many new sales calls can you realistically handle per month”
   * Slider 4 to 40, default 10.

Everything else is derived.

---

### 5.7 Screen 6 – Prospects per month (volume slider)

**Goal:** Let them choose outbound volume, give immediate live estimate ranges, and respect TAM.

**Data from CSV:**

* `estimated_business_count`
* `pcpl_min`, `pcpl_max` for that industry
* `starter_volume_default` (for example 10000)
* Optional `max_suggested_volume`.

**Global constants:**

* `lead_to_appointment_rate = 0.4`
* `max_touches_per_business = 2`.

**Input:**

* Slider labelled:

  * `How many prospects do you want us to contact each month for this niche`

* Slider config:

  * Minimum: 5000 or 10000 (configurable).
  * Default: `starter_volume_default` or 10000.
  * Maximum: `min(50000, estimated_business_count * max_touches_per_business)`.

**Live outputs under slider (update as they move):**

Copy example:

> “With **[prospects_per_month]** [industry_plural_label] contacted per month, our data for [Industry] campaigns suggests:”

* `Leads: [leads_min] to [leads_max] per month`
* `Booked appointments: [appointments_min] to [appointments_max] per month`
* `New clients: [clients_min] to [clients_max] per month`
* A small line: “This is an estimate based on our database, not a guarantee.”

If requested volume exceeds realistic TAM:

* Disable invalid values and show text:

  * “Looks like this niche does not have enough local businesses to safely contact [requested] per month. We should probably talk about neighboring niches. We can cover this on a strategy call.”

On submit, store:

* `prospects_per_month`
* Calculated `leads_min`, `leads_max`, `appointments_min`, `appointments_max`, `clients_min`, `clients_max` so you do not recompute everywhere.

Next: Screen 7.

---

### 5.8 Screen 7 – Sales capacity

**Goal:** Sanity check that projected appointments match their ability to take calls, so you can speak about throttling or prioritizing.

**Input:**

* Slider:

  * Label: `How many new sales calls can you or your team realistically handle per month`
  * Min: 4
  * Max: 40
  * Default: 10.

On submit, store `capacity_calls_per_month`.

Next: Screen 8.

---

### 5.9 Screen 8 – Process visualization

**Goal:** Show your system in a way that feels like a data driven pipeline, now using their niche and service type.

**Display:**

A four step timeline card, with micro animations if you want.

1. **Scan and build the list**

   * “We map the [Industry] market in our internal directory, niche specific sites and Google Maps style sources, then pull a clean list of **[prospects_per_month] local businesses** that fit your ICP.”

2. **Turn your results into outreach**

   * “We plug your [service_type] case studies into our messaging library for [Industry] and generate campaigns that speak to the outcomes they care about.”

3. **Handle replies and qualify**

   * “Our team handles positive replies, answers questions and calls interested prospects to qualify for budget and urgency, so you only see serious [Industry] owners on your calendar.”

4. **You take the calls and close**

   * “You get a steady stream of qualified sales calls, and we keep feeding the top of the funnel so pipeline is not an issue.”

At bottom:

* “Based on our outbound datasets, most agencies see deals closing over **2 to 12 weeks** from first touch to signed client, depending on deal size and complexity.”

Button: `See your projected revenue` → Screen 9.

---

### 5.10 Screen 9 – Results and revenue summary

**Goal:** Flash the money, keep it credible, and tie everything explicitly to their inputs.

**Use previously calculated and stored values.**

#### 9.1 Headline

“Here is what this can add to your agency each month”

#### 9.2 Input echo line

Short line at top:

> “For a [service_type] agency targeting [industry_plural_label], contacting **[prospects_per_month]** local businesses per month, with your close rate of **[close_rate_percent] percent** and pricing of **$[price_low] to $[price_high] per client**, here is a realistic outcome based on our database.”

#### 9.3 Results blocks

**Block A – Funnel numbers**

* Prospects contacted: **[prospects_per_month] per month**
* Leads: **[leads_min] to [leads_max] per month**
* Booked appointments: **[appointments_min] to [appointments_max] per month**
* New clients signed: **[clients_min] to [clients_max] per month**

  * Subtitle: “Using your close rate of [close_rate_percent] percent on qualified calls.”

Capacity flag:

* If `appointments_max > capacity_calls_per_month * 1.5`:

  Small highlighted note:

  > “You told us you can handle about **[capacity_calls_per_month]** new sales calls per month.
  > At this volume we expect **[appointments_min] to [appointments_max]**. That is fine, we can throttle or prioritize the strongest opportunities so you are not overwhelmed.”

This positions you as thoughtful, not reckless volume pushers.

**Block B – Revenue impact**

* MRR range:

  > “Based on your pricing of **$[price_low] to $[price_high]** per month per client, this volume can realistically add:”
  >
  > **$[mrr_low] to $[mrr_high] in new monthly recurring revenue**,
  > once the pipeline has ramped and deals from these appointments start to close.

* Annualized:

  > “On a yearly basis that is roughly **$[annual_low] to $[annual_high]** in extra revenue from this niche alone, assuming stable performance.”

Keep numbers aggressive but within the model.

#### 9.4 “How we calculated this” breakdown

Collapsible panel:

Text link: `Show how we calculated these estimates`.

Expanded text should spell out the logic in plain language using their values, for example:

* “You chose **[prospects_per_month]** prospects per month.”
* “For [Industry], our dataset shows about **1 lead per [pcpl_min_adj] to [pcpl_max_adj] prospects**.”
* “For this estimate we used a mid point of **1 lead per [pcpl_mid] prospects**.”
* “So at [prospects_per_month] prospects, that is roughly **[leads_mid] leads per month**.”
* “About **40 percent** of those leads usually book a call, so that is **[appointments_mid] appointments per month**.”
* “You told us you close about **[close_rate_percent] percent** of qualified calls, which gives about **[clients_mid] new clients per month**.”
* “With your pricing of **$[price_low] to $[price_high]**, that is **$[mrr_low] to $[mrr_high]** in new MRR.”

The exact numbers can be your mid points, while you show ranges above.

Include a one line disclaimer:

* “These are estimates from our historical data, not a guarantee for your agency.”

#### 9.5 Call to action

Big bold card at bottom:

* “Want us to walk through these numbers one to one and stress test them for your agency”
* Button: `Book a strategy call`

On click:

* Open your Calendly or booking URL in new tab.
* Pass the following as hidden fields or query params if possible:

  * `industry`
  * `service_type`
  * `prospects_per_month`
  * `leads_range`
  * `appointments_range`
  * `clients_range`
  * `price_low`
  * `price_high`
  * `close_rate`.

So sales opens the booking and instantly sees what the calculator showed them.

## 6. Calculation logic

All logic should live in a utility module so you can test it outside the UI.

### 6.1 Inputs to the calculator

* `industry_config` from CSV or JSON:

  * `estimated_business_count`
  * `pcpl_min`
  * `pcpl_max`
  * `starter_volume_default`
  * Optional `max_suggested_volume`.

* Global constants:

  * `lead_to_appointment_rate = 0.4`
  * `max_touches_per_business = 2`
  * `case_study_multipliers = { none: 1.2, some: 1.0, strong: 0.8 }`
  * Defaults for industries not in CSV:

    * `default_pcpl_min = 450`
    * `default_pcpl_max = 650`.

* User inputs:

  * `case_study_strength`
  * `price_low`, `price_high`
  * `close_rate` (for example 0.2)
  * `prospects_per_month`.

### 6.2 Adjusted PCPL

Get base values:

* `pcpl_min_base`, `pcpl_max_base` from industry config, or defaults.

Apply case study multiplier:

* `multiplier = case_study_multipliers[case_study_strength]`
* `pcpl_min_adj = pcpl_min_base * multiplier`
* `pcpl_max_adj = pcpl_max_base * multiplier`

Lower PCPL is better performance.

For mid point explanations, you can also compute:

* `pcpl_mid = (pcpl_min_adj + pcpl_max_adj) / 2`.

### 6.3 Lead range

Given `prospects_per_month`:

* `leads_min = round(prospects_per_month / pcpl_max_adj)`
* `leads_max = round(prospects_per_month / pcpl_min_adj)`

So min uses worst PCPL, max uses best PCPL.

You can also compute `leads_mid` for explanation:

* `leads_mid = round(prospects_per_month / pcpl_mid)`.

### 6.4 Appointment range

Using `lead_to_appointment_rate`:

* `appointments_min = round(leads_min * lead_to_appointment_rate)`
* `appointments_max = round(leads_max * lead_to_appointment_rate)`
* `appointments_mid = round(leads_mid * lead_to_appointment_rate)`.

Tune PCPL values per niche so that at 10000 prospects, your default industries land around **8 to 12 appointments**. That is your anchor.

### 6.5 Client range

Using self reported close rate:

* `clients_min = max(1, round(appointments_min * close_rate))`
* `clients_max = max(1, round(appointments_max * close_rate))`
* `clients_mid = max(1, round(appointments_mid * close_rate))`.

You can cap or floor these if needed to keep ranges tidy.

### 6.6 MRR range

Using pricing:

* `mrr_low = clients_min * price_low`
* `mrr_high = clients_max * price_high`

Round to nearest hundred for display.

Annual:

* `annual_low = mrr_low * 12`
* `annual_high = mrr_high * 12`.

---

## 7. Data model

### 7.1 Industry configuration CSV

Headers:

* `industry_key`
* `industry_display_name`
* `industry_plural_label`
* `estimated_business_count`
* `pcpl_min`
* `pcpl_max`
* `starter_volume_default`
* `max_suggested_volume` (optional)
* Optional `notes` or `example_text`.

Convert to JSON at build time or fetch via API.

### 7.2 Global config JSON

Example:

```json
{
  "lead_to_appointment_rate": 0.4,
  "max_touches_per_business": 2,
  "case_study_multipliers": {
    "none": 1.2,
    "some": 1.0,
    "strong": 0.8
  },
  "default_pcpl_min": 450,
  "default_pcpl_max": 650
}
```

---

## 9. Design and tone guidelines

* **Tone:**

  * Feels like a **serious calculator** backed by data, not a toy.
  * Copy should clearly say things like “based on our internal datasets for [Industry] campaigns”.

* **Numbers:**

  * Always present **ranges** for leads, appointments, clients and revenue.
  * Avoid single hard promises.

* **Visuals:**

  * Clean cards, strong hierarchy, big numbers.
  * Progress indicator visible on all steps.
  * Primary CTA fixed near bottom for mobile.

* **Mobile first:**

  * Screen width stack, one main choice or slider per view.
  * Large touch targets, minimal typing.
  * Keep copy short above the fold, details in collapsible sections.

* **Aggressive ROI copy with guardrails:**

  * Do not shy away from bold ranges like “$9,000 to $36,000 in new MRR”.
  * Always pair with “based on our historical data, not a guarantee”.
